# Entando JBoss EAP 7.1 Base Image 

Overview


The Entando JBoss EAP 7.1 Base Image is not intended to be run directly, but to be extended in other contexts that could leverage
its functionality. It provides all the JBoss EAP and Java/Maven build infrastructure to allow extending images to build a war file
from a Maven project, and then to deploy the resulting war file to /opt/eap/standalone/deployments. 

In addition to this, it also provides the necessary functionality to build two local Derby databases, the Entando SERV database 
and the Entando PORT database. Even though this image itself is not compliant 
with the Openshift Source-to-image specification, it does provide some of the infrastructure to build an image from sources. 
One can use the 'assemble' script (located at /usr/local/s2i/assemble) to build a war file and the supporting 
Derby databases from a Maven project. 


## Database construction process
The databases will typically be built and populated from one of two possible sources inside the Maven project

### The Entando plugins listed as dependencies.
When this image detects a Maven project with no SQL backups, it starts up Entando and allows all the plugins configured
in the project to create the tables they require, and then allows them to populate these tables with the necessary default data.

### A SQL Backup inside the Maven project 
If this image detects a standard Entando database backup in SQL format at the location src/main/webapp/protected, it restores the database
from this backup

Once the databases have be built and populated, the 'assemble' script copies both databases to a the directory /entando-data-templates/databases. 
When a container is started from this image, it detects whether the container already has fully populated databases in the 
/entando-data/databases directory. If none is detected, it copies the database template directory across thus ensuring that 
the databases reflect the correct initial state for the associated Entando app.

### Inherited Environment Variables.

This image extends the official Red Hat JBoss EAP 7.1 image for Opensfhit with minimal modifications to the original logic. Feel free
to experiment with the environment variables documented in the
[original image](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform/7.1/html/red_hat_jboss_enterprise_application_platform_for_openshift/configuring_eap_openshift_image)  

## Ports

**8080** - {PORT_8080}
**8778** - {PORT_8778}
**8888** - {PORT_8888}
**8443** - {PORT_8443}


## Volumes

**/entando-data**: the standard 'entando-data' volume is mounted at /entando-data. This directory contains the uploaded resources, protected resources and indices, as well as the two
embedded Derby databases for optional use. 

## How to run

This image was not intended to be run directly in Docker. Extend the image to support the Openshfit S2I functionality, or
use it as a base image in a Maven build or a Dockerfile
