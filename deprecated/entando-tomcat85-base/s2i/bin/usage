This is an Entando S2I tomcat-8.5.38 running with java-8 compiling with maven-3.5.4 centos base image responsible for consuming a java maven tomcat project
and deploying it onto Apache-Tomcat application server.
To use it, install S2I: https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image.

Sample invocation:

s2i build git://github.com/example/openshift-tomcat-example entando/tomcat-s2i tomcattest

You can then run the resulting image via:
docker run -p 8080:8080 tomcattest

Details:
If a pom.xml is present in the source directory, the project is built with maven and the
output war file in the target/ dir will be copied into the Tomcat webapps directory.

If there is no pom.xml, but a war file is found in the source root, it will be moved to tomcat webapps directory.

The default Maven build arguments can be overridden by setting MAVEN_ARGS via the "--env" argument to S2I
default MAVEN_ARGS=clean install -DskipTests.
The default Maven build arguments can be appended by setting MAVEN_ARGS_APPEND.

This image does not support incremental builds because Entando require an excessive amount of dependencies.
