# Entando JBoss EAP 7.1 Cluster Ready Base Image

The Entando JBoss EAP 7.1 Cluster Ready Base Image directly extends the [Entando JBoss EAP 7.1 Base Image](https://github.com/entando/entando-ops/tree/credit-card-dispute/Docker/base-images/entando-eap71-base).
Please consult the parent image's documentation for a better understanding of how to configure this image. The only difference between this
image and the Entando JBoss EAP 7.1 Base Image is that it has enabled the cluster ready caches for the Entando Infinispan plugin.
