# Entando Wildfly 12 Base Image

The Entando Wildfly 12  7.1 Base Image is not intended to be run directly, but to be extended in other contexts that could leverage
its functionality. It provides all the Wildfly and Java/Maven build infrastructure to allow extending images to build a war file
from a Maven project, and then to deploy the resulting war file to /wildfly/standalone/deployments. 

In addition to this, it also provides the necessary functionality to build two local Derby databases, the Entando SERV database 
and the Entando PORT database. Even though this image itself is not compliant 
with the Openshift Source-to-image specification, it does provide some of the infrastructure to build an image from sources. 
One can use the 'assemble' script (located at /usr/libexec/s2i/assemble) to build a war file and the supporting 
Derby databases from a Maven project. 


## Database construction process
The databases will typically be built and populated from one of two possible sources inside the Maven project

### The Entando plugins listed as dependencies.
When this image detects a Maven project with no SQL backups, it starts up Entando and allows all the plugins configured
in the project to create the tables they require, and then allows them to populate these tables with the necessary default data.

### A SQL Backup inside the Maven project 
If this image detects a standard Entando database backup in SQL format at the location src/main/webapp/protected, it restores the database
from this backup

Once the databases have be built and populated, the 'assemble' script copies both databases to a the directory /entando-data-templates/databases. 
When a container is started from this image, it detects whether the container already has fully populated databases in the 
/entando-data/databases directory. If none is detected, it copies the database template directory across thus ensuring that 
the databases reflect the correct initial state for the associated Entando app.


## Environment Variables

### Entando specific Environment Variables
**PORTDB_URL** - the full JDBC connection string used to connect to the Entando PORT database

**PORTDB_DRIVER** - the name of the driver for the Entando PORT database as configured in the JEE application server

**PORTDB_USERNAME** - the username of the user that has read/write access to the Entando PORT database

**PORTDB_PASSWORD** - the password of the above-mentioned username.

**PORTDB_SERVICE_HOST** - the  name of the server that hosts the Entando PORT database.

**PORTDB_SERVICE_PORT** - the port on the above-mentioned server that serves the Entando PORT database. Generally we keep to the default port for each RDBMS, e.g. for PostgreSQL it is 5432

**SERVDB_URL** - the full JDBC connection string used to connect to the Entando SERV database

**SERVDB_DRIVER** - the name of the driver for the Entando SERV database as configured in the JEE application server

**SERVDB_USERNAME** - the username of the user that has read/write access to the Entando SERV database

**SERVDB_PASSWORD** - the password of the above-mentioned username.

**SERVDB_SERVICE_HOST** - the  name of the server that hosts the Entando SERV database.

**SERVDB_SERVICE_PORT** - the port on the above-mentioned server that serves the Entando SERV database. Generally we keep to the default port for each RDBMS, e.g. for PostgreSQL it is 5432
 
**Please note**: When the SERVDB_URL  and the PORTDB_URL variables are specified, the corresponding *_SERVICE_HOST and *_SERVICE_PORT 
variables will be ignored.

**ENTANDO_OIDC_ACTIVE** - set this variable's value to "true" to activate Entando's Open ID Connect and the related OAuth authentication infrastructure. If set to "false"
all the subsequent OIDC  variables will be ignored. 

**ENTANDO_OIDC_AUTH_LOCATION** - the URL of the authentication service, e.g. the 'login page' that Entando needs to redirect the user to in order to  allow the OAuth provider to authenticate the user.

**ENTANDO_OIDC_TOKEN_LOCATION** - the URL of the token service where Entando can retrieve the OAuth token from after authentication

**ENTANDO_OIDC_CLIENT_ID** - the Client ID that uniquely identifies the Entando App in the OAuth provider's configuration

**ENTANDO_OIDC_REDIRECT_BASE_URL** - the optional base URL, typically the protocol, host and port (https://some.host.com:8080/) that will be prepended to t
he path segment of the URL requested by the user and provided as a redirect URL to the OAuth provider. If empty, the requested URL will be used as is.

**KIE_SERVER_BASE_URL**: The base URL where a KIE Server instance is hosted, e.g. http://entando-kieserver701.apps.serv.run/

**KIE_SERVER_USERNAME**: The username of a user that be used to log into the above-mentioned KIE Server

**KIE_SERVER_PASSWORD**: The password of the above-mentioned KIE Server user.

### Inherited Environment Variables.

This image extends the open source Wildfly S2I image for Opensfhit with minimal modifications to the original logic. Feel free
to experiment with the environment variables documented in the
[original image](https://github.com/openshift-s2i/s2i-wildfly)  

## Ports

**8080** - the port for the HTTP service hosted by Wildfly


## Volumes

**/entando-data**: the standard 'entando-data' volume is mounted at /entando-data. This directory contains the uploaded resources, protected resources and indices, as well as the two
embedded Derby databases for optional use. 

## How to run

This image was not intended to be run directly in Docker. Extend the image to support the Openshfit S2I functionality, or
use it as a base image in a Maven build or a Dockerfile
