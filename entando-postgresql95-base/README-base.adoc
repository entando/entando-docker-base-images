# Entando PostgreSQL 9.5 Base Image

The Entando Postgresql 9.5 Base Image is not intended to be run directly, but to be extended in other contexts that could leverage
its functionality. It provides all the PostgreSQL and Java/Maven build infrastructure to allow extending images to build two
local PostgreSQL databases, the Entand SERV database and the Entando PORT database. Even though this image itself is not compliant 
with the Openshift Source-to-image specification, it does provide some of the infrastructure to build an image from sources. 
One can use the 'assemble' script (located at /usr/libexec/s2i/assemble) to build a database from a Maven project. 

## Database construction process
The databases will typically be built and populated from one of three possible sources inside the Maven project

### The Entando plugins listed as dependencies.
When this image detects a Maven project with no SQL or binary backups, it starts up Entando and allows all the plugins configured
in the project to create the tables they require, and then allows them to populate these tables with the necessary default data.

### A SQL Backup inside the Maven project 
If this image detects a standard Entando database backup in SQL format at the location src/main/webapp/protected, it restores the database
from this backup

### A Binary Backup inside the Maven project
If this image detects that a database backup was generated using the `PG-db-backup-tar` Ant task in the project, it will then use Ant
to restore the database.

Once the databases have be built and populated, the 'assemble' script copies both databases to a the directory /var/lib/pgsql/data_template.
When a container is started from this image, it detects whether the container already has fully populated databases in the /var/lib/pgsql/data
directory. If none is detected, it copies the data_template directory across thus ensuring that the two databases reflect the correct initial
state for the associated Entando app.

##Environment Variables 

### Entando specific Environment Variables
The following environemt variables are specific to the Entando extension in this image.

**PORTDB_DATABASE** - the name of the Entando PORT database that is created and hosted in the image
**PORTDB_USERNAME** - the username of the user that has read/write access to the Entando PORT database
**PORTDB_PASSWORD** - the password of the above-mentioned username.
**SERVDB_DATABASE** - the name of the Entando SERV database that is created and hosted in the image
**SERVDB_USERNAME** - the username of the user that has read/write access to the Entando SERV database. For compatibility with mvn jetty:run, please keep this the same as PORTDB_USERNAME
**SERVDB_PASSWORD** - the password of the above-mentioned username.  For compatibility with mvn jetty:run, please keep this the same as PORTDB_PASSWORD
**ADMIN_USERNAME** - the username of a user that has admin rights on both databases. For compatibility with Postgresql, keep this value to 'postgres'
**ADMIN_PASSWORD** - the password of the above-mentioned username.

### PostgreSQL Environment Variables to use
Since this image extends the offical PostgreSQL Docker Image for Openshift, it inherits a lot of the functionality available in the parent image.
As such, it supports the following environment variables that can be used to customize the databases created:
**POSTGRESQL_MAX_CONNECTIONS**  - The maximum number of client connections allowed. This also sets the maximum number of prepared transactions.
**POSTGRESQL_SHARED_BUFFERS** - Configures how much memory is dedicated to PostgreSQL for caching data.

### PostgreSQL Environment Variables not to use
The Entando specific functionality in this image deviates from the original functionality in that it generates two databases as opposed 
to a single database. For this reason, the following environment variables will be overwritten by their Entando-specific counterparts:

**POSTGRESQL_USER**
**POSTGRESQL_PASSWORD**
**POSTGRESQL_DATABASE**
**POSTGRESQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD**

##Ports

**5432** - the port that the PostgreSQL server is running. 

##Volumes 

**/var/lib/pgsql/data** - map this volume to a persistent volume on your Docker host.

## How to run

It is not recommended for this image to be run direclty in Docker. Rather extend this image for Openshift's S2I or extend it from a Maven project
